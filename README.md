## Introduction

What could be better than being able to use the same technology to quickly and cheaply deliver fresh produce, fruits, and animal products to your doorstep at a time when technology is at its peak as a tool to make our lives easier? How simple is it?
The “SaruBima” mobile app is made to support new small business owners while also giving them a place to market and sell their foods. The main goal of our app is to give new sellers a platform where they can improve their employability while also making money without using middlemen and prevent unemployeebility. We think that by combining education and opportunity, a group of capable people will emerge who can strengthen their local economies and communities.
