## Introduction

What could be better than being able to use the same technology to quickly and cheaply deliver fresh produce, fruits, and animal products to your doorstep at a time when technology is at its peak as a tool to make our lives easier? How simple is it? 
We designed a mobile application " සරුබිම" exclusively for the project's overarching goal is to provide farmers, unemployed and small-scale businessman with a platform to sell their goods more successfully and for a higher price by removing middlemen and putting them in contact with customers directly.  
Small scale business owners are the hardest hit by economic crisis, but the project will benefit consumers and the local economy by providing affordable, fresh, locally sourced goods. 
The platform probably includes features like product listings, pricing, order management, and payment. sellers will be able to display their products, complete with pictures and descriptions. The seller is notified when a customer places an order, and the customer is notified after the seller conveys the order. 
On the other hand, customers will be able to browse the products that are offered, place orders, and make payments online. Additionally, they might be able to rate and review goods, which could help farmer enhance their product lines and draw in more clients. 
The project can have a positive impact on the local economy, support small farmers, and promote sustainable agriculture.
